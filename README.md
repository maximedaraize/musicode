Making music with code using Tidal Cycle &amp; SuperCollider

## Getting Started

### Install Tidal Cycle & SuperCollider (MacOs)

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidalcycles/tidal-bootstrap/master/tidal-bootstrap.command -sSf | sh
```

## Step by Step

Once the script is installed, open:

- SuperCollider and open the `superColliderConfig.scd` file
- Run each command by pressing the `Shift + Enter` key on each line following the order of each step

You might have to change the Audio setting of your Mac. To do so, you need to go to **Audio MIDI Setup** and change the `Output Device` to `Mac OSX Built-in Output - 'MacBookPro Speakers'` and then change the `Output Format` to `44,100 Hz` format from `48,000 Hz`.

- Open Atom Code Editor that was installed on your machine, or Vs-Code and install the Tidal Cycle Extension.

- Create a file with the extension `.tidal` or open the `music.tidal` file from this repo.

To run the code in the file you'll have to press `Control + Enter` or `Command + Enter`;

You should be hearing a beat.
